Vision\nTo become a Centre of Excellence comparable to the best in the world; helping define\naspirations and possibilities for the long term, and producing \u2018life and career ready\u2019\nprofessionals with leadership qualities, who are ready to challenge and be challenged -in\nthe areas of technology, innovation, management and entrepreneurship.\n2. Mission\n(a) To develop as a benchmark University in higher and professional education.\n(b) To provide a qualitative premium education and learning experience in the higher\neducation space in a world-class infrastructure and research driven academic\nenvironment, to students looking for a well-rounded academic experience with\nenhanced employability prospects; and\n(c) To harness human capital for sustainable competitive edge and social relevance.\n3. Objectives\nThe University shall disseminate advanced knowledge and skills by providing instructional,\nresearch and extension facilities in such branches of learning as it may deem fit. The\nUniversity shall endeavor to provide to students and teachers the necessary atmosphere\nand facilities for the promotion of:\n(a) innovations in education leading to restructuring of courses, new methods of\nteaching, training and learning including on-line learning, blended learning ,\ncontinuing education and such other methods, leading to integrated & wholesome\ndevelopment of personality;\n(b) studies and research in various disciplines;\n(c) inter-disciplinary studies; and\n(d) National integration, secularism, social equity and engineering of international\nunderstanding and ethics.\n4. Academic Philosophy\nAcademic Philosophy of the University is built around five key dimensions:-\n(a) Global Academic Partnerships.\n(b) High Caliber National and International Faculty.\n(c) Industry-Centric Curriculum.\n(d) Entrepreneurial Thinking.\n(e) Life and Career Ready Students.\n2",

The University shall achieve the same through:\n(a) Student Centric Teaching.\n(b) Teaching That Builds Critical Thinking Abilities.\n(c) Inspiring Learning Environment.\n(d) Innovative Teaching.\n(e) Multidimensional Options.\n(f) Extracurricular Dimensions.\n6. Teaching Methodology / Pedagogy\nThe University will ensure creation of curriculum and teaching practices where the\ntraditional teacher-centric approach is changed largely to student-centric approach;\ncombining the strength of face to face teaching with the power of technology enhanced\nlearning, laying emphasis on blended learning, attempting to introduce concepts such as\nproblem based learning and collaborative group learning. This shall combine the best\npractices in pedagogy with appropriate e-learning tools to take care of the individual\ndifferences amongst learners of various classes and intellectual calibers. This is based on\nfact that:\n(a) Knowledge in every field will continue to grow at an ever increasing rate.\n(b) ICT tools will continue to make access to high quality learning resources easier with\nevery passing day.\n(c) Even a four year period is too short a time to learn/teach everything, forcing all\nprofessionals to learn many new knowledge and skills throughout their lives and\nmostly on their own.\n(d) Graduates of the 21st century should have the ability to arrive at informed\njudgments i.e, to effectively define problems, gather and evaluate information\nrelated to those problems and develop solutions.\n7. Pedagogic Principles\n(a) Small group collaborative learning. Suitable groups shall be formed; assigning the\nrole of leadership to different members of the group for different\nassignments/tasks/problems/ projects/learning outcome. This implies formation of\nvirtual collaborative groups exchanging roles at suitable intervals\n(b) Following Principle of Active learning.\n(c) Student centric learning.\n(d) Problem based learning. Students may be given well designed assignments/\nproblems/ tasks/ projects starting with each unit learning objectives, learning\nobjectives of a group of units, learning objectives of a complete module, groups of\nmodules, full course and where possible even a group of courses.\n3",

Stages of learning\nThe sequence of studies during under graduate programs broadly shall consist of four\nstages.\n(a) The first stage will be an introduction to sciences, humanities and technical arts (such\nas workshops etc.). This shall be common for all UG programs.\n(b) The Second stage shall encompass the study of engineering courses that emphasize a\nbroad based knowledge in interdisciplinary areas which enables the students to\nappreciate the links between science, engineering and humanities.\n(c) In the third stage the students shall be exposed to subjects in the chosen areas of\nstudy which dwell on the principles governing design and which develop in them the\nability for physical and analytical modeling, design and development.\n(d) Students are initiated into the methods of research, Library reference work, use of\nengineering Scientific equipment\u2019s/instruments, learning of modern computational\ntechniques and writing of technical and scientific reports.\n(e) In parallel with the last two stages, the student shall be introduced to the social and\neconomic objectives of the era and to the interaction between man, machine and\nnature. This is sought to be achieved through elective courses in humanities and\nsocial sciences and through practical training, fieldwork, works visits and seminars.

He/she has the full\nresponsibility for coordinating the course, coordinating the work of other members of the\nfaculty involved in that course, holding the tests and awarding the grades. In case of any\ndifficulty, the student is expected to approach the course coordinator for advice and\nclarification.\nA letter grade, corresponding to specified number of grade points, is awarded in each\ncourse for which a student is registered. On obtaining a pass grade, the student\naccumulates the course credits as earned credits. A student\u2019s performance is measured by\nthe number of credits that he/she has earned and by the weighted grade point average. A\nminimum number of credits should be acquired in order to qualify for the programs.\n13. Credit Assignment\nLectures/Tutorials: One lecture/tutorial hour per week per semester is assigned one\ncredit.\nPractical\u2019s: One laboratory hour per week per semester is assigned half credit.\nHowever, some courses may be of preparatory nature and have half the credit weightage\nof a normal course while a few courses are without credit and are referred to as noncredit\n(NC) courses.\n14. Earned Credits (EC)\nThe credits assigned to a course in which a student has obtained \u2018D\u2019 (minimum passing\ngrade) or a higher grade will be counted as credits earned by him/her. Any course in which\na student has obtained F, W or NF grade will not be counted towards his/her earned\ncredits.\n15",
